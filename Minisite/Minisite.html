  <ul><strong>Bonsai Sloth Umbrellas</strong></ul>
  <ul>An umbrella or parasol is a folding canopy supported by wooden or metal ribs, which is usually mounted on a wooden, metal, or plastic pole. It is designed to protect a person against rain or sunlight. The word "umbrella" typically refers to a
    device used for protection from rain. The word parasol usually refers to an item designed to protect from the sun. Often the difference is the material used for the canopy; some parasols are not waterproof. Umbrella canopies may be made of
    fabric or flexible plastic.

    Umbrellas and parasols are primarily hand-held portable devices sized for personal use. The largest hand-portable umbrellas are golf umbrellas. Umbrellas can be divided into two categories: fully collapsible umbrellas, in which the metal pole
    supporting the canopy retracts, making the umbrella small enough to fit in a handbag; and non-collapsible umbrellas, in which the support pole cannot retract and only the canopy can be collapsed. Another distinction can be made between manually
    operated umbrellas and spring-loaded automatic umbrellas which spring open at the press of a button.

    Hand-held umbrellas have some type of handle, either a wooden or plastic cylinder or a bent "crook" handle (like the handle of a cane). Umbrellas are available in a range of price and quality points, ranging from inexpensive, modest quality
    models sold at discount stores too expensive, finely made, designer-labeled models. Larger parasols capable of blocking the sun for several people are often used as fixed or semi-fixed devices, used with patio tables or other outdoor furniture,
    or as points of shade on a sunny beach. The collapsible/folding umbrella, the direct predecessor to the modern umbrella, originated in China.These Chinese umbrellas were internally supported with bendable, retractable, and extendable joints as
    well as sliding levers similar to those in use today.</ul>

  <ul><strong>Bonsai Sloth Umbrella Slang</strong></ul>
  <ul>The word "parasol" (Spanish or French) is a combination of para, meaning to stop or to shield, and sol, meaning sun. "Parapluie" (French) similarly consists of para combined with pluie, which means rain (which in turn derives from pluvia, the
    Latin word for rain). Hence, a parasol shields from sunlight while a parapluie shields from rain. (Parachute means "shield from fall".)

    The word "umbrella" evolved from the Latin umbella (an umbel is a flat-topped rounded flower) or umbra, meaning shaded or shadow.

    In Britain, umbrellas were sometimes referred to as "gamps" after the character Mrs. Gamp in the Charles Dickens novel Martin Chuzzlewit, although this usage is now obscure. Mrs. Gamp's character was well known for carrying an umbrella.

    “Brolly” is a slang word for umbrella, used often in Britain, Ireland, New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, and Kenya.

    “Bumbershoot” is a fanciful Americanism from the late 19th century.</ul>

  <ul><strong>For Protection Against Attackers</strong></ul>
  <ul>In 1838, the Baron Charles Random de Berenger instructed readers of his book How to Protect Life and Property in several methods of using an umbrella as an improvised weapon against highwaymen.

    In 1897, journalist J. F. Sullivan proposed the umbrella as a misunderstood weapon in a tongue-in-cheek article for the Ludgate Monthly.

    Between 1899 and 1902, both umbrellas and walking sticks as self defence weapons were incorporated into the repertoire of Bartitsu.

    In January 1902, an article in The Daily Mirror instructed women on how they could defend themselves from ruffians with an umbrella or parasol.

    In March 2011 media outlets revealed that French president Nicolas Sarkozy has started using a £10,000 armor-plated umbrella to protect him from attackers. "Para Pactum" is a Kevlar-coated device made by The Real Cherbourg. It will be carried by
    a member of Sarkozy's security team.[47]

    During the 2014 Hong Kong protests, sometimes referred to as the "Umbrella Revolution", protesters used umbrellas as shields against pepper spray and tear gas from riot police.[48]</ul>

  <ul><strong>As A Weapon Of Attack</strong></ul>
  <ul>John Steed in the television series the Avengers used an umbrella which was part yardstick.
    In 1978 Bulgarian dissident writer Georgi Markov was killed in London by a dose of ricin injected via a modified umbrella. The KGB is widely believed to have developed a modified umbrella that could deliver a deadly pellet.[49]

    In 2005 in a well-known case in South Africa, Brian Hahn, associate professor in mathematics and applied mathematics at the University of Cape Town was beaten to death with an umbrella by ex-doctoral student Maleafisha Steve Tladi.[50]

    In the 1992 film Batman Returns, the Penguin (Danny DeVito) sports a bullet and gas-firing umbrella.

    A high-tech bullet-resistant umbrella is used extensively as a weapon in the 2015 film Kingsman: The Secret Service by characters Harry Hart (Colin Firth) and Eggsy Unwin (Taron Egerton).

    In the Kirby video game series, one of Kirby's Copy Abilities, called Parasol, has Kirby using a parasol as a weapon. It is also used to slow Kirby's descent when in the air.</ul>

    <ul>We are a completely made-up company that does not exist at all. Since we are imaginary, we can pretend to produce umbrellas that can be used for any purpose whatsoever. Our umbrellas are way better than the umbrellas of other competitors
      that actually exist because our umbrellas don't need to follow the rules of physical reality. Plus we have a cool sloth as our logo. That's so much better than any other umbrella company, right?</ul>
