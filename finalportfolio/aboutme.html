    <p>
      I am an 18 year old highschool graduate as of March 24, 2019. I work at Pizza Hut in Grand Ledge Michigan at the moment but am working on finding a new and better job. I have five sisters and only one brother. I like to play video games,
      listen to music and hangout with friends on my free time. One of my favorite things to do is ride my longboard with my friends because we are outside and just get to talk about things and ride or cruise through where ever we are going. The
      type of music that I like most people that I know don't, I listen to heavy metal, screamo, I listen to some rap, and I like some musical styled songs. Sometimes when I am not doing anything and get bored I like to draw and some of the
      time I end up drawing some pretty cool things.
